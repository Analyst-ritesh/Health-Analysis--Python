# Health Survey Data Analysis- Python

This project aims to analyze health survey data to gain insights into the general health, healthcare practices, and lifestyle habits of survey participants. The dataset contains various health-related questions and personal information about the respondents. The objective is to extract meaningful insights to improve healthcare recommendations and policies.

## Key Objectives:

The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

Health Assessment: Analyze self-reported general health status, healthcare practices, and the prevalence of specific health conditions among survey participants.
Lifestyle Habits: Examine exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits among participants.
Body Mass Index (BMI) Analysis: Investigate the distribution of BMI values and their correlation with health and lifestyle factors.
Demographic Analysis: Explore the age distribution and family size of the participants.


## Data Processing:
Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Python environment using libraries like Pandas.
Data Cleaning: Address any missing or inconsistent data, correct data types, and ensure data integrity.
Data Transformation: Perform data transformations if necessary, such as converting date columns to datetime objects.
